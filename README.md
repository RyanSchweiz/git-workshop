# Git Workshop

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

### Installation
If you don't have git installed you can install by following the tutorial for your operating system.

| Operating System | Tutorial |
| ------ | ------ |
| Windows | https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows |
| OSX / Mac | https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x |
| Debian / Ubuntu | https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux |


### Github
Github is a service for hosting git repositories. Sign up for an account if you haven't already because you'll need it for this workshop. (https://github.com/)

### Forking the Original Project
We are going to fork the original project on Github. Forking allows you to create a copy of a repository and make changes to it without affecting the original project. Now that we are logged into Github, go to the original project at https://github.com/zach-wild/git-workshop.

### Cloning this repository
Cloning a repository downloads it so that you have a local copy to work with.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/git-workshop.git <directory>
$ cd <directory>/git-workshop
```
Now we have a local copy of this repository that we can make changes to.

### Configuration
We are going to follow this tutorial to configure git to work with your github account. (https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html)
